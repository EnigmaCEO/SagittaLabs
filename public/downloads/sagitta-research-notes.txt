Below is a legit, plain-text research notes file that reads like real internal thinking — exploratory, incomplete, and disciplined. It avoids claims, avoids SCE gravity, and fits naturally beside the implementation sketches.

Sagitta Research Notes
Status: Working notes / non-final
Audience: Internal research and design

This document captures exploratory thinking related to capital continuity, stress modeling, and allocator policy tuning. These notes are not specifications and may change as systems evolve.

Research Area 1: Continuity Model Assumptions

Continuity is treated as a design property, not a runtime guarantee.

Assumptions:

Capital systems will experience partial failure rather than total collapse

Not all subsystems fail simultaneously

Human intervention may be delayed, unavailable, or conflicting

Data inputs may degrade before systems fully fail

Continuity design prioritizes:

bounded behavior under uncertainty

preservation of core invariants

graceful degradation over optimization

recovery paths that do not require perfect information

Open questions:

What minimum signal set is required to maintain safe operation?

How long can systems operate under stale or degraded data?

Which invariants must never be violated, even under extreme uncertainty?

Research Area 2: Capital Stress Scenarios (Placeholders)

These scenarios are conceptual placeholders used to test assumptions, not predictions.

Scenario classes under consideration:

Liquidity contraction across correlated assets

Pricing oracle divergence or staleness

Volatility regime shifts exceeding historical norms

Counterparty or venue unavailability

Governance paralysis or delayed coordination

Stress modeling goals:

identify invariant breakpoints

understand compounding failure effects

observe allocator behavior under constraint tightening

measure recovery latency rather than peak loss

Open questions:

Which stress signals matter earliest?

How should constraint strictness change under stress?

When is inaction safer than forced reallocation?

Research Area 3: Policy Tuning and Constraint Design

Policy tuning focuses on constraint behavior, not performance maximization.

Primary tuning dimensions:

position concentration limits

liquidity sensitivity

rebalance frequency

volatility tolerance

regime transition thresholds

Design principles:

constraints should be explicit and reviewable

constraint interactions should be predictable

policy behavior should degrade conservatively

policies should avoid hidden optimization pressure

Observed tensions:

responsiveness versus stability

diversification versus liquidity depth

drawdown avoidance versus recovery participation

Open questions:

How conservative should default policies be?

Should policies self-tighten under uncertainty?

How much policy discretion is acceptable before review?

Research Area 4: Decision Interpretability

Decision interpretability is treated as a first-order research concern.

Assumptions:

decisions will be reviewed after the fact

reviewers may not be the original designers

explanation quality affects governance trust

Research focus:

minimal explanation sets

separating signal from narrative

avoiding post-hoc rationalization

aligning explanations with doctrine language

Open questions:

What is the smallest explanation that preserves meaning?

How should uncertainty be communicated?

When should explanations defer to constraints rather than signals?

Research Area 5: Long-Horizon Behavior

Sagitta systems are expected to operate over long horizons.

Considerations:

policy drift over time

regime bias accumulation

silent constraint erosion

operator complacency

Research directions:

periodic policy review cadence

drift detection heuristics

long-horizon simulation runs

institutional memory via Decision Records
